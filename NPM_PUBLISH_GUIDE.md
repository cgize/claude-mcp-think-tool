# Publishing to npm without local download

There are several ways to publish this package to npm without needing to download it locally:

## Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)

1. **Set up a GitHub Secret**:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Click on "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
   - Create a new repository secret named `NPM_TOKEN`
   - Set the value to your npm token (the one you previously created)

2. **Create a workflow file**:
   - Create a directory `.github/workflows` in your repository
   - Add a file named `publish.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Publish to npm

on:
  release:
    types: [created]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version:
        description: 'Version to publish (e.g., 1.0.0)'
        required: true
        default: ''

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16.x'
          registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org/'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Update version if provided
        if: github.event.inputs.version != ''
        run: |
          npm version ${{ github.event.inputs.version }} --no-git-tag-version

      - name: Publish to npm
        run: npm publish --access public
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

3. **Trigger publication**:
   - Go to "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Select the "Publish to npm" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Enter the version number (e.g., "1.0.0")
   - Click "Run workflow"

## Option 2: One-time temporary clone using Gitpod or Codespaces

If you don't want to set up GitHub Actions, you can use an online editor:

1. **Gitpod**:
   - Open Gitpod with your repository: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/cgize/claude-mcp-think-tool
   - Run in the terminal:
     ```bash
     npm login  # Use your npm credentials
     npm run build
     npm publish --access public
     ```

2. **GitHub Codespaces**:
   - Open your repository on GitHub
   - Press `.` (period) to open in web editor or click "Code" → "Open with Codespaces"
   - Run the same commands as with Gitpod

## Option 3: Use a GitHub Action for publishing (manual setup)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Click "New workflow"
4. Click "set up a workflow yourself"
5. Copy and paste the workflow YAML from Option 1
6. Commit the file
7. Don't forget to add your NPM_TOKEN in repository secrets
